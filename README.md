### Strategies
- Time allocation for preparation is about one week, dedicating 3–4 hours daily. To pass the exam you need to score 700 marks.
- The exam is 2 hours long, including a 20-minute survey time. So, you will have around 1 hour and 40 minutes to tackle approximately 42–46 questions. This should allow you sufficient time to carefully respond to each question.
- Please be careful as for some questions you are not allowed to go back for some questions.
- During self-paced learning, pay particular attention to hands-on labs as they provide valuable experience and insight into answering many exam questions.
- Familiarize yourself with the functions of various Azure AI services and their corresponding endpoints.
- Be aware that there is no hands-on coding in the exam.
- However, you will need to choose your preferred coding language (Python or C#) at the beginning of the test for drag-and-drop questions and to understand the code snippet type questions.
- If you encounter questions you are unsure about, try to think logically and apply your intuitive understanding gained from hands-on labs, as they can often lead to the correct answers.
- There is no negative exam marking in the exam.
